# ctrl-VQE with Julia, m1

Welcome! This is Kyle's first attempt at implementing ctrl-VQE in Julia.
The goal is to produce a working code giving results numerically similar to Oinam's `ctrlq` repository,
    and to test out faster evolution methods.

As this is Kyle's first foray into Julia, there is no expectation of perfectly-optimized code,
    (although he is having fun trying to do so anyways!).
In particular, exactly zero effort is being made to make this code parallelizable.
That will come in a lower-priority second attempt.
