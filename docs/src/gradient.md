# Gradient
```@meta
CurrentModule = Gradients
```

This module contains methods for constructing gradient signals in time,
    subject to a particular observable and a time evolution.

This module isn't as thoroughly thought out as `Evolutions`,
    although both will probably change drastically in the near future.

```@docs
gradientsignal
```

Note that some additional auxiliary methods are also implemented in this module.
Study the documentation in code if you are curious,
    but they aren't necessarily meant for "public consumption". ^_^
