#= TODO: There are a couple points where we were stubbornly resisting
        the "flexible methods, rigid structs" paradigm.
    Double check that looser methods don't slow you down, then go all in.
=#

#= TODO: Structs should allow for alternate float precision. =#

#= TODO: Match notation in notebook. HIC‚ÜíV, V‚ÜíL, expHIC‚ÜíE, etc.

Also temp variables look awkward.
Do something like `_` prefix to indicate it's an allocation,
    then `1D` or `2D` for the vector vs. matrix distinction,
    then `N` or `n` to indicate size,
    then finally a `_` suffix to indicate array.
`tmpK_` can change to something more innocuous like `_p_`

#= TODO: I/O and QubitApply can be :symbols instead of types, I think. =#

    evolve(œàI, args...; kwargs...)

Shorthand for a not-in-place function to evolve a state `œàI` in time.

This just copies œàI to a new variable then calls `evolve!`, so find documentation there!

        device::Devices.Device;
        iobasis::IOBasisMode = DeviceBasis()
    )

Evolve the state `œà` in time.

# Arguments
- `œà` initial statevector of `n>0` qubits each with `m` levels
- `pulses` vector of `n` pulse templates
- `device` the `n`-qubit device giving qubit frequencies and couplings
- `iobasis` which basis the input is interpreted as, and output converted to

The amount of time evolved is determined by the duration of the pulses,
    which are assumed to have equal duration.

All evolutions are performed in the interaction-picture,
    meaning the static time dependence due to device eigenenergies is implicit.
In other words, if there are no pulses, the input state doesn't change at all.
This is distinct from the textbook "Schrodinger picture",
    where an eigenvector of the device Hamiltonian with eigenvalue ``œâ``
    would after a time ``T`` incur a phase shift ``\\exp(ùíäœâT)``.

The input/output basis may be controlled with the `iobasis` keyword argment.
The choices are:
- `QubitBasis()` computational states correspond to product states of individual qubits.
- `DeviceBasis()` computational states are eigenstates of the static device Hamiltonian.
  Note that the default device Hamiltonian factorization uses a so-called  "dressed basis"
    (see `Utils.dressedbasis`) but alternative factorizations can usually be passed in
    manually as keyword arguments when calling `evolve!` with a specific algorithm.

The specific algorithm can be selected by passsing an `EvolutionMode`
    as a final positional argument.
These are enumeration structs defined within the `Evolutions` module;
    study the method headers below for supported types.
Note you must pass the raw type (eg. `ODE`) rather than a singleton object (eg. `ODE()`).

Each algorithm includes additional keyword arguments;
    consult the individual method documentation for details.
In particular, note that most algorithms involve a "setup" phase,
    doing expensive calculations that only need to be done once ever for a given device.
So, if you are planning to call `evolve!` *more* than once (eg. optimizing pulse parameters)
    you should take advantage of the optional keyword arguments
    that let you skip those expensive calculations.
Study the method headers for each mode in the code for the requisite details.

Numerically integrate Schrodinger's equation.

This method uses state-of-the-art algorithms to adaptively integrate
    a set of coupled differential equations.
That is my way of saying I don't actually know how this method works.

It is extremely accurate for a single qubit,
    so I consider it the "gold standard" for accuracy estimations.
I've no idea how its runtime scales with system size.

                Interestingly, I think I can cut down those allocations by a factor of two
                by manually diagonalizing `tmpM`
                then doing in-place matrix multiplications.

                In fact, `exp` seems to be doing a different algorithm entirely,
                since...its argument is not _Hermitian_.
            ...it's *anti*-Hermitian! That is dumb. Maybe worth filing an issue over.
                Anyways, the algorithm being used is called "squaring and scaling".
                I dunno how it works but it seems to be a bit slower,
                at least for the limited N=100 test I did in the REPL.
                The point is we can probably cut time in two by manually exponentiating.

Trotterize the time evolution operator,

    so that the time evolution in each is more efficient.

This method invokes a number of matrix-vector multiplications (``O(N^2)``),
    and some small matrix exponentiations (``O(n¬∑m^3)``) at each time step.
Of the more efficient algorithms, this is the easiest to understand,
    and it will tend to be the most performant also.

The keyword argument `numsteps` specifies the number of time steps;
    time scales linearly, and accuracy scales inversely.

The keyword argument `qubitapplymode` specifies the numerical approach to

The choices are:
- `Kronec()` this method combines all qubit-wise operators into a single N√óN matrix,
    then applies them with a single matrix-vector multiplication.
- `Tensor()` this method reshapes the statevector into an n-dimensional array,
    and performs a tensor contraction over each qubit-wise operator.
  In principle this one should scale significantly better than `Kronec`,
    but in practice the overhead from tensor manipulation may be steep.

Trotterize the time evolution operator,
    but switch back and forth between the static and drive bases
    so that the time evolution in each is more efficient.
Additionally, decompose the drive Hamiltonian into two time-independent components,
    so that all time evolution can be computed by only
    matrix-vector multiplications and vector exponentiations.

This method is almost identical to the `Rotate` method,
    but evades *all* eigenvalue calculations within a time step.
Thus, it invokes only matrix-vector multiplications (``O(N^2)``)
    and vector exponentiations (``O(N)``) at each time step.
It sounds at first impression like it should be even faster than `Rotate`,
    but it turns out ``N`` is usually bigger than ``n¬∑m^3`` so it's not...
Additionally, it incurs some extra error from the drive Hamiltonian factorization.

The keyword argument `numsteps` specifies the number of time steps;
    time scales linearly, and accuracy scales inversely.

The keyword argument `qubitapplymode` specifies the numerical approach to
    applying the qubit-wise drive operators at each time step.
The choices are:
- `Kronec()` this method combines all qubit-wise operators into a single N√óN matrix,
    then applies them with a single matrix-vector multiplication.
- `Tensor()` this method reshapes the statevector into an n-dimensional array,
    and performs a tensor contraction over each qubit-wise operator.
  In principle this one should scale significantly better than `Kronec`,
    but in practice the overhead from tensor manipulation may be steep.

The keyword argument `suzukiorder` controls the product formula
    used to expand the drive Hamiltonian.
- Suzuki order 1 corresponds to ``\\exp(A¬∑B)‚âà\\exp(A)¬∑\\exp(B)``
- Suzuki order 2 corresponds to ``\\exp(A¬∑B)‚âà\\exp(A/2)¬∑\\exp(B)¬∑\\exp(A/2)``
- Suzuki order 0 isn't really a thing but this method uses it to correspond to
    ``\\exp(A¬∑B)‚âà\\exp(A)¬∑\\exp(B)¬∑\\exp(-[A,B]/2)``.
  In fact, for the decomposition used, this formula is algebraically exact.
  Unfortunately, this exactness vanishes completely when representing
    bosonic algebra with finite matrices, so it's only useful for large `m`,
    which are, alas, computationally inaccessible.
  In other words, don't bother with `suzukiorder=0`...
- Higher-order product formulae are mathematically defined, but not implemented.
