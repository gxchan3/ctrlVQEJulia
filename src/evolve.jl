- `œàI` initial statevector of `n>0` qubits each with `nstates` levels

- `device` the `n`-qubit device giving qubit frequencies and couplings
- `numsteps` the number of discrete time units to simulate (ie. Trotter steps)

    This part is weird -
        we're using an auxiliary function to summarize the routine for each Trotter step,
        but each Suzuki-order needs a different set of auxiliary variables.
    So, the function takes three vaguely-named variables M1, M2, M3.
        The values they take are set here.

    TODO: a more elegant solution would be to let these auxiliary variables live
        in a global scope. Best is a Dict( nstates => <the thing> ).
        The auxiliary function can just assume that, if it's been called,
            the appropriate dictionaries have been pre-filled.
        Then we can replace `M1, M2, M3` with just `nstates`.
    =#
    M1 = (suzukiorder == 0) ? Q : _iŒîtŒõ         # Exact solution needs Q and P to build HC.
    M2 = (suzukiorder == 0) ? P : UPQ           # Suzuki needs _iŒîtŒõ for time evolution,
                                                #   and UPQ to connect the two factors.

Auxiliary function to evolve control Hamiltonian in time.

This is a strange function, in that its starting state `œà`
    and its arguments `M1`, `M2`, `M3` are very different
    depending on value of `suzukiorder`.

`suzukiorder == 0`
    `œà` is in qubit basis
    `M1` is matrix representation of canonical operator Q ‚â°    a+a'
    `M2` is    "           "      of     "         "    P ‚â° -i(a-a')
    `M3` is unused

`suzukiorder == 1`
    `œà` is in so-called "P" basis (ie. rotated to diagonal basis of P on each qubit)
    `M1` is eigenvalues of Q operator (or P, they're the same) scaled by -ùíäŒît
    `M2` is unitary matrix to rotate from P -> Q basis
    `M3` is unused

`suzukiorder == 2`
    `œà` is in so-called "Q" basis (ie. rotated to diagonal basis of Q on each qubit)
    `M1` is eigenvalues of Q operator (or P, they're the same) scaled by -ùíäŒît
    `M2` is unitary matrix to rotate from P -> Q basis
    `M3` is unitary matrix to rotate from Q -> P basis

TODO: The `œà` will remain weird.
    But `M1`, `M2`, `M3` should be moved to global Dicts, keyed by `nstates`
    (which can be passed as an auxiliary argument, or inferred by `œà` and `pulses`).
